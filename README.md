## Requirements
nodeJS

## Install Nightwatch

Install [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org/) globally
```
 $ sudo npm install -g nightwatch
```

## Download Selenium

[Download](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) the latest version of the selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar file from the Selenium downloads page and place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. In most cases this will be on your local machine and typically inside your project's source folder.

A good practice is to create a separate subfolder (e.g. bin) and place it there as you might have to download other driver binaries if you want to test multiple browsers.
